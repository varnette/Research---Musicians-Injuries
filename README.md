## Prevalence and Perceptions of Student Musicians' Playing Related Injuries

## Highlight

**In my first year as a physical therapist, I conducted this study and was invited to present my findings at the national Combined Sections Meeting (CSM) of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) in Washington, DC, providing valuable education to fellow physical therapists.**

## Purpose

The purpose of my study was to quantify the incidence of playing-related injuries (PRIs) among collegiate musicians and to determine whether physical therapy is utilized in treating this patient population. Professional musicians experience high rates of playing-related injuries due to the repetitive and demanding nature of their practice and performances. Despite this, these injuries have historically been under-recognized and under-treated in the field of physical therapy and rehabilitation. The survey serves as a needs assessment to inform campus healthcare providers about the necessity for comprehensive rehabilitation services, including physical therapy, to support the College of Music Student Population. 
## Study Methodology

I conducted this study through a 14-question survey designed to examine the prevalence and perceptions of playing-related injuries among collegiate musicians at the university of Colorado Boudler College of Music. . The survey covered injury rates, locations, impacts on performance, access to care, and attitudes toward healthcare. 

## Key Findings

- **61.5%** of respondents expressed concern about developing a playing-related injury (PRI) in the future.
- **57.7%** of respondents reported experiencing a lack of understanding from healthcare providers regarding the physical demands of being a musician.
- **40%** of respondents without a history of PRI still experienced occasional pain while practicing.
- **90%** of respondents with a history of PRI did not receive care from a physical therapist.

## Conclusion

The findings from my study highlight an unmet need for injury prevention and management among collegiate musicians. The results underscore the importance of offering specialized physical therapy and other rehabilitation services to this population to ensure optimal performance and career longevity. Given that musiciansâ€™ wellness is an under-studied area in the world of physical therapy and rehabilitation, I was addressing a significant public health gap by providing this education.

## Presentation

This study was recognized for its significance and was selected for presentation at the CSM in Washington, DC, where I shared my insights and provided education to fellow physical therapists about the critical need for increased awareness and resources for injury prevention and management among collegiate musicians, thus filling an unmet public health need.
